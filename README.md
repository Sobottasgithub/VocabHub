## 2. 📁  Creating a Vocabulary File

Because Vocabhub uses the JSON format as its file type, it's very easy to create your vocabulary files either manually or with the built-in editor. The file should look something like this:

```json
{
  "Apfel" : "Apple",
  "Haus"  : "House",
  "Schule": "School",
  "language A": "language B"
}
```
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Language A and B need to be a language chosen from one of the choiceboxes in the visual editor. If not the application might not read the file correctly!

You can also use the built-in editor provided on the second **Add New** tab to create or edit a vocabulary file.
